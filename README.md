<h2>04 Web-APIs Homework Code Quiz</h2>

This homework asked me to create a simple timed multiple choice quiz that followed this criteria:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

I look forward to developing this final project even further. Thank you.
